# hello-world

This is a hello world repository.

The changes in this commit are about my plans for being more active in my GitHub account.

This simple exercise is to keep my GitHub account active as I have not created a repository in a long while.

In future, I will be uploading code for various python projects in web bots, web scrapping, internet monitoring and AI.
